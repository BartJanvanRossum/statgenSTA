Description: The statgen packages, developed by Biometris, are developed to 
    streamline the analysis of typical plant breeding experiments, including 
    both phenotypic analysis of field trials and genotype-by-environment 
    analysis. statgenSSA can be used for phenotypic analysis of field trials 
    using spatial models. Some functions have been created to be used in 
    conjunction with the R package 'asreml' for the 'ASReml' software, which 
    can be obtained upon purchase from 'VSN' international 
    (<http://www.vsni.co.uk/software/asreml-r>).
