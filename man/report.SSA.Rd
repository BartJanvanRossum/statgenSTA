\title{Report method for class SSA}
\usage{
\method{report}{SSA}(x, ..., trial = NULL, trait = NULL,
  descending = TRUE, outfile = NULL, what = c("fixed", "random"))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class SSA.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to the report function.}

\item{trial}{A character string indicating the trial to be reported. If
\code{NULL} and \code{SSA} contains only one trial, that trial is reported.}

\item{trait}{A character string indicating the trait to be reported. If
\code{NULL} and \code{SSA} contains only one trait, that trait is reported.}

\item{descending}{Should the trait be ordered in descending order? Set to
\code{FALSE} if low values of the trait indicate better performance.}

\item{outfile}{A character string, the name and location of the output .pdf
and .tex file for the report. If \code{NULL}, a report with a default name
will be created in the current working directory.}

\item{what}{A character string indicating whether the model with genotype
fixed or genotype random should be reported. Can be omitted if only one
model has been fitted.}
}
\value{
A pdf and tex report.
}
\description{
A pdf report will be created containing a summary of the results of the
fitted model. Simultaneously the same report will be created as a tex file.
}
\examples{
## Fit model using lme4.
myModel1 <- fitTD(TD = TDHeat05, design = "ibd", traits = "yield")
\dontrun{
## Create a pdf report summarizing the results for the model with genotype
## as fixed factor.
report(myModel1, outfile = "./testReports/reportModelLme4.pdf",
       what = "fixed")
## Create a pdf report summarizing the results for the model with genotype
## as random factor. Order the results in ascending order.
report(myModel1, outfile = "./testReports/reportModelLme4.pdf",
       what = "random", descending = FALSE)
}
