\title{Identifying outliers in objects of class SSA}
\usage{
outlierSSA(SSA, trials = NULL, traits = NULL, what = c("fixed",
  "random"), rLimit = NULL, commonFactors = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{SSA}{An object of class \code{\link{SSA}}.}

\item{trials}{A character vector specifying the trials for which outliers
should be identified. If \code{trials = NULL}, all trials are included.}

\item{traits}{A character vector specifying the names of the traits for
which outliers should be identified.}

\item{what}{A character string indicating whether the outlier should be
identified for the fitted model with genotype as fixed or genotype as random
factor.}

\item{rLimit}{A numerical value used for determining when a value is
considered an outlier. All observations with standardized residuals
exceeding \code{rLimit} will be marked as outliers.}

\item{commonFactors}{A character vector specifying the names of columns
in \code{TD} used for selecting observations that are similar to the
outliers. If \code{commonFactors = NULL}, only outliers are reported and
no similar observations.}

\item{verbose}{Should the outliers be printed to the console?}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\itemize{
\item{indicator - a list of numeric vectors indicating the location of the
outliers in the data}
\item{outliers - a data.frame containing the outliers and observations
similar to the outliers as defined by \code{commonFactors}}
}
}
\description{
Function to identify observations with standardized residuals exceeding
\code{rLimit}. If not provided \code{rLimit} is computed as
\code{qnorm(1 - 0.5 / rDf)} where \code{rDf} are the residual degrees
of freedom for the model. This value is then restricted to the interval
2..4. Alternatively a custom limit may be provided.\cr
If \code{verbose = TRUE} a summary is printed of outliers and observations
that have the same value for \code{commonFactors}. The latter ones will be
marked as similar to distinguish them from the former ones.

\examples{
## Fit a model using lme4.
myModel <- fitTD(TD = TDHeat05, traits = "yield", design = "res.rowcol",
                engine = "lme4")
## Detect outliers in the standardized residuals of the fitted model.
outliers <- outlierSSA(SSA = myModel, traits = "yield")
